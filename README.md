sudo cp target/release/devtimer /usr/local/bin/
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# Start tracking time
devtimer start Working on feature X

# Stop the timer
devtimer stop

# View statistics for the last entry
devtimer statistics
```

### Commands

#### Start Timer

## 📁 Data Storage

DevTimer stores all tracking data in a `saved_times.json` file in the current directory. The file contains:
- Task description
- Start timestamp
- Stop timestamp (when stopped)

**Example JSON structure:**
```json
[
  {
    "text": "Working on feature X",
    "timestamp_start": "2026-02-08 14:30:00",
    "timestamp_stop": "2026-02-08 16:45:30"
  }
]
```

## 🛣️ Roadmap
